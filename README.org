* SlideOutStayAwake

Extremely simple app/service to keep an Android device from going to sleep while the hardware keyboard is open.
Will not unlock the device if it is already locked when the keyboard is opened.

Basically, my "Hello World" app for Android which scratches the above mentioned itch.
For some reason I could not find an existing way to get this behaviour in (stock) android.
